#Ambient PVC

Ambient PVC is a generative music system designed to accompany performances on a ney style PVC flute.

An audio can be found on [Bandcamp](https://dominguezaudio.bandcamp.com/track/ambient-pvc)

Run main.pd to get started. Ambient PVC uses the [plugin~] object from PD-extended and the plate2x2 LADSPA plugin from [CAPS](http://quitte.de/dsp/caps.html). If you don't have either of these it shouldn't affect anything beyond the quality of reverberation used in the patch.

If you want to build your own flute you can use fluteCalc.lua to figure out where to put the wholes. Tweak the variables in the file to match your requirements.
